# Predicting Car Sale Price

This repository contains a Machine Learning project that develops a predictive model using one algorithm, validates and improves the predictive accuracy of the model using another algorithm. The project also showcases various data cleaning and feature selection/scaling exercises to process and make the raw data usable for analysis. 

### Objectives

Below is the list of questions that we are looking to answer as a result of this Predictive Modeling (Machine Learning) project:

* How to develop a machine learning model using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm?

* How to verify and validate the machine learning model using the K-Fold Cross Validation algorithm?

* How can these two separate approaches be implemented to mitigate the mode fitting and improve model performance?

* What are the effects of underfitting (high bias) and overfitting (high variance) over the model predictability?

* How to apply some of the data cleaning, transforming and feature selecting techniques?

* How does feature selection from the training examples impact the overall predictability of the model? 

* How does model unfamiliarity with the training set and cross-validation/external data set impact its predictability performance?


### Goal Significance

Why does the list of objectives mention above matter? What benefit can we derive by understanding the K-Nearest Neighbors and K-Fold Cross Validation algorithm? Below are some of the goals that we can enlist. Following of this technique will help us: 

* To determine the impact of select highly significant features over the model performance by using unscrutinized data (with ample features) vs. scrutinized data.

* To visualize the effect of underfitting and overfitting with relevance to the number of clusters / type of algorithm used / level of data scrutinization etc.

* To understand the effect of the number of clusters over the model predictability. 

* To identify and remove features that we donâ€™t want to use in the model. 

* To transform features into the proper format, e.g. scaling of numerical data, filling in the missing values etc.

* To verify the impact of the above actions by checking on model predictive errors and comparing the results.

### Code Explanation

Once get fork permission:

* Download the .py file and 'databank' folder together.  

* Retain the relative folder tree structure. 

* The native python file (.py) shuold remain in the root directory.

* The python file extracts data from the .csv database that exists in the databank folder. 

* Execute the .py file in root.
